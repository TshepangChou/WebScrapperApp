# WebScrapperApp
A web scraping application using Java.

Building a web scraping application in Java that scrapes data from multiple websites, stores it in a database, and includes features like user input, data cleaning, and scheduling can be a valuable project. Here's a breakdown of how to structure the application and sample code snippets for each section.

Project Breakdown:
* Web Scraping: Use JSoup to scrape data from websites.
* Database: Use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to store scraped data in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
* User Input: Allow users to input the URLs of the websites they want to scrape.
* Data Cleaning: Clean the scraped data to ensure it's properly formatted before storing it.
* Scheduling: Use ScheduledExecutorService to schedule regular scrapes.

Dependencies:
* JSoup: For scraping data from websites.
* JDBC: For connecting to and interacting with the database.
* MySQL Connector: To connect Java to MySQL (if using MySQL).

Key Features:
* User Input: The program prompts the user to enter the website URL they want to scrape.
* Data Scraping: Using JSoup, it extracts the content of specific elements (e.g., <h1> for titles and <p> for paragraphs).
* Data Cleaning: The scraped data is cleaned by trimming unnecessary whitespace.
* Database Storage: The cleaned data is stored in a MySQL database using JDBC.
* Scheduling: The ScheduledExecutorService runs a scraping task every hour, automatically scraping a list of websites.

Running the Program:
* Ensure that your MySQL database is set up and running.
* Update the database connection details (DB_URL, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD) with your actual credentials.
* Run the WebScraperApp class. The user will be prompted for URLs to scrape, and the data will be stored in the database.
* The program will also scrape the predefined list of websites at regular intervals.

Some future Enhancements:
* Error Handling: Implement retry mechanisms for handling failed scrapes.
* Data Formatting: Further clean the data (e.g., removing HTML tags, dealing with special characters).
* Web Interface: Add a web interface (using a Java web framework like Spring Boot) for easier interaction.
* Multi-threading: Use parallel scraping to speed up the process for multiple websites.
